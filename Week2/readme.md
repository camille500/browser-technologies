# Feature 1 - Geolocation

Geolocation is not yet supported by all browsers, I've build a really simple example of a fallback that can be used to prevent problems if someones browser doesn't support the feature.

1. There is a check if the Geolocation feature is available.
2. If the feature is available, the location will be printed on the page (longitude and latitude).
3. If the feature is not available, a form will show where the user can enter its own location.

Using this fallback, the user can fill in it's location. If the geolocation functionality does work, its easier for the user. But if the functionality doesn't work, we can ask the user where he is.
